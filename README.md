# Hide and Seek
Welcome to the docs! Thank you for visiting. Click the `Docs` tab towards the top to view the *documentation*. Click the `API` tab towards the top to view the *advanced usage of functions, objects, and code within the template*.

# ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️
The hide and seek documentation is still under construction. `API` is still in the works, but for now, you can view `Docs` to learn how to use the template.

`Docs` is also under construction, but is still usable. The video tutorial semi-explains how to get stuff to work, but for now, you can look at the base gamemodes, configurations, and scripts to learn the basics of how to use the game template.
