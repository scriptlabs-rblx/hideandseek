# Intro
Welcome to the documentation for your `Hide and Seek Roblox Template`! First off, thank you for your purchase. It helps me to be motivated to create more game templates, and it helps fund, for example, purchasing maps and assets. Let's get started.

#### The documentation will cover the following:
* Configuration of:
	* Gamemodes
	* Maps
	* Settings
* Monetization, including:
	* Gamepasses (ex. `2x Wins`, `Faster Movement`, etc.)
	* Developer Products (ex. `+5 Wins`, `+10 Wins`, etc.)
* Much more will be covered in the future as updates come, this is just the base of what you can configure in `V1.0.0` of your `Hide and Seek Roblox Template`.

You will begin with configuration, chapter I being **configuration of gamemodes**.
